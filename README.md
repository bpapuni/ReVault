# ReVault Addon

ReVault is a World of Warcraft addon designed to share the contents of your Great Vault with other players (gloat to your guildies).

4. **Profit:** Others with the addon will be able to open the link to view the rewards in your Great Vault, and your current gear that each reward would replace.
